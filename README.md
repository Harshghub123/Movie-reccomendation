# Movie Recommendations System

The Movie Recommendations System is a Python-based project that suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, DuffKub, scikit-learn, TfidfVectorizer, and cosine similarity.

## Description

The Movie Recommendations System is designed to provide users with movie recommendations tailored to their preferences. By analyzing user behavior and applying collaborative filtering techniques, the system generates accurate recommendations.

## Features

- User Preference Collection: Users can input their movie preferences, such as genres and release years.
- Recommendation Generation: Based on user preferences, the system generates a list of recommended movies using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity.
- Data Processing: Utilizing NumPy and Pandas, the system preprocesses the movie dataset to extract relevant features for recommendation generation.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: The scikit-learn library is used for implementing collaborative filtering and cosine similarity algorithms.
- Text Vectorization: The TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn is employed to transform movie descriptions into numerical feature vectors
